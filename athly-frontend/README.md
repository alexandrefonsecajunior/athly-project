## Mocked login

Use any email and password to sign in. Login does not validate credentials.

## Future integration

To connect with a real backend:

1. Configure `VITE_API_URL` and `VITE_GRAPHQL_URL` in `.env`
2. Set `VITE_USE_REAL_API=true` to use the real API
3. Services in `/services` are already structured to swap mocks for real calls
4. Apollo Client is already configured in `/services/graphql/client.ts`
